C-Binary_Trees

## Overview

C-Binary_Trees is a collection of various binary tree data structures and algorithms implemented in the C programming language. Binary trees are widely used in computer science and are essential for efficient data storage and retrieval.

This repository aims to provide simple yet efficient implementations of binary trees for educational and practical purposes.

## Binary Trees Included

The following binary tree implementations are currently included in this repository:

1. Binary Search Tree: A binary tree structure designed for efficient searching of elements, where the left child node is less than the parent node, and the right child node is greater than the parent node.

2. AVL Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree that ensures the tree remains balanced, providing efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

3. Binary Heap: A complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property, where the parent node is always greater (or smaller) than its children. It is commonly used to implement priority queues.

4. Trie: A tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval of keys. It is primarily used for storing and searching strings.

Each implementation comes with clear explanations of the data structure's logic and algorithms.

## How to Use

To use any of the binary tree implementations from this repository in your C project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
